                <h1>Every Child Deserves An Education</h1>
                <h2> IT'S THE LAW. ASK THE NYS EDUCATION DEPT. TO DO THEIR JOBS AND ENFORCE IT.</h2>

            <p class="explain">  In New York State, tens of thousands of children are being denied a secular education in Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox yeshivas. </p>
                
            <p class="explain">  This is in flagrant violation of New York State’s “substantial equivalency” law, which requires all private schools to offer a curriculum that is at least substantially equivalent to that of public schools.</p>
                
            <p class="explain"> For decades, government officials did not enforce the law, but now New York State is ready to act.  </p>
                
            <p class="explain">   On July 3rd, the State Education Department proposed regulations to make sure every private school, including yeshivas, is providing instruction in English, math, science, and social studies. The state is now soliciting public comment on these regulations before presenting them to the Board of Regents for approval. </p>
                
            <p class="explain"> WE URGE YOU TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD: Let the State Education Department know that you support efforts to ensure all children, regardless of where they go to school, receive the education to which they are entitled under law. </p>

                                    <textarea id="letter output" readonly> GENERAL PUBLIC: We, the undersigned, call upon New York’s education officials to ensure that all children residing in New York — whether in public or non-public schools — be provided with an education that meets New York State’s requirements. 
                                    
The problem is particularly acute as regards many of New York’s Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox yeshivas. New York State Education Law (Article 65, Section 3204) mandates that all children attending non-public schools receive an education that is “substantially equivalent” to that of public schools. More specifically, the law requires all non-public schools to provide instruction in English, mathematics, science and social studies among other subjects.
                                        
The law notwithstanding, many of New York State’s Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox yeshivas are not meeting these requirements, to the detriment of the tens of thousands of students who attend these schools. Even more disturbing is that the New York State and New York City Departments of Education have done little to address this problem, despite having been aware of it for many years.
                                        
As the new school year approaches, thousands of newly school-aged children—as well as those already enrolled—will receive a substandard secular education or no secular education at all. Despite all their years in the classroom, the students in these many yeshivas will leave 12th grade without having received that which New York’s Court of Appeals has repeatedly affirmed is required under the law—namely a “sound basic education.” The majority of these students are, as a result, ill-prepared to enter the workforce or to contribute productively to the larger society.
                                        
We therefore urge State Commissioner Elia and City Chancellor Carranza to enforce Section 3204. These officials are duty-bound to compel these schools to provide the education that the law of New York requires and that the children of New York deserve.
                                        
Our signatures on this petition evince our resolve to stand up for the rights of these children, the welfare of our communities and, indeed, for the rule of law.</textarea></p>

                                <textarea id="letter" readonly> YESHIVA PARENTS: We, the undersigned, call upon New York’s education officials to ensure that all children residing in New York — whether in public or non-public schools — be provided with an education that meets New York State’s requirements. 
                                
            The problem is particularly acute as regards many of New York’s Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox yeshivas. New York State Education Law (Article 65, Section 3204) mandates that all children attending non-public schools receive an education that is “substantially equivalent” to that of public schools. More specifically, the law requires all non-public schools to provide instruction in English, mathematics, science and social studies among other subjects.
                                    
            The law notwithstanding, many of New York State’s Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox yeshivas are not meeting these requirements, to the detriment of the tens of thousands of students who attend these schools. Even more disturbing is that the New York State and New York City Departments of Education have done little to address this problem, despite having been aware of it for many years.
                                    
            As the new school year approaches, thousands of newly school-aged children—as well as those already enrolled—will receive a substandard secular education or no secular education at all. Despite all their years in the classroom, the students in these many yeshivas will leave 12th grade without having received that which New York’s Court of Appeals has repeatedly affirmed is required under the law—namely a “sound basic education.” The majority of these students are, as a result, ill-prepared to enter the workforce or to contribute productively to the larger society.
                                    
            We therefore urge State Commissioner Elia and City Chancellor Carranza to enforce Section 3204. These officials are duty-bound to compel these schools to provide the education that the law of New York requires and that the children of New York deserve.
                                    
            Our signatures on this petition evince our resolve to stand up for the rights of these children, the welfare of our communities and, indeed, for the rule of law.</textarea></p>
